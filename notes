NDN - with 2 way flooding

Basics: 
    DataObject      An object of data that has a Name and is generated by a Producer
    Consumer        Requester of DataObjects
    Producer        Generator of DataObjects 
    Router          Handles DataObject delivery
    Name            A unique identifier for a DataObject
    Interest        A request for a DataObject made by a Consumer and passed by Routers
    Ad              An advertisement that a Producer has a DataObject
    Note*           These objects are conceptual and don't necessarily correspnd to actual classes

Details:
    Every iteration of the event loop corresponds to some discrete time unit
    Producers generate a certain number of DataObjects every iteration
    Producers broadcast a certain number of Ads every iteration
    Consumers broadcast a certain number of Interests every iteration
    Routers handle incoming Interests, Ads, and DataObjects according to [research_notes]
